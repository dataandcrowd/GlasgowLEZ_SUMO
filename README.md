## If you are using SUMO for the first time
* Make sure you install SUMO following the website https://eclipse.dev/sumo/

## What if the SUMO file doesn't open?
* Maybe you are opening a large network file
    * The network file in 03_Expand-Area (`.net.xml`) needs to be extracted
* Maybe you are **not** a windows user.
    * You need to run it from terminal
    * Once you launched terminal and located at the folder: hit `sumo-gui glasgow_new.sumocfg`
